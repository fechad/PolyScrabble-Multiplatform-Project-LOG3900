This is a copy of my third year integrator project at Polytechnique Montreal for the course LOG3900.
This is a multiplatform online multiplayer Scrabble game developed for 2 systems: Windows 10 and Android 11.0.

The code for the windows app is located in "client" folder. The code for the android app is located in "client_leger" folder. 

Note: The deployed AWS server has been taken down along with firebase api services due to budgetary restricitons.
